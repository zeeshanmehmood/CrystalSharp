<img align="right" alt="Crystal Sharp" src="https://github.com/zeeshanmehmood/CrystalSharp/blob/main/assets/icon/icon-128x128.png?raw=true" />
Crystal Sharp is a framework that facilitates the creation of business applications, microservices, Web APIs, Web apps, and small apps. It offers features like CQRS, Domain-driven design (DDD), event sourcing, read model stores, sagas, distributed messaging, and data storage for both RDBMS and NoSQL. The Crystal Sharp framework is designed to make application development easier and faster. The Crystal Sharp framework is entirely asynchronous and written in C#.

### Salient Features
* Offers a clean and efficient approach for developing business applications, microservices, Web APIs, Web apps, and small apps.
* Easy to setup and use.
* Fluent configuration API.
* CQRS - Commands, Queries and Notifications.
* Domain-driven Design (DDD).
* Supports a wide range of databases, including RDBMS like Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and RavenDB.
* Event Sourcing is well-supported through the use of native EventStoreDB as well as RDBMS options like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB.
* Read Model Store - Offers efficient storage of flat and optimized data, supporting RDBMS such as SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, as well as NoSQL options like Elasticsearch and MongoDB.
* Sagas and transactions are well-backed, offering reliable features. Sagas can be implemented by using either the choreography or orchestration approach.
* Seamlessly communicate across distributed systems using Azure Service Bus and RabbitMQ messaging capabilities.

### Branches
